# Challenge 05 - Work Day Scheduler

This project is to create a scheduler for the current day, with the timeframe being from 9AM to 5PM. When opening the scheduler, the title is displayed as well as the current day and date. Scrolling down the user will be presented with time blocks from 9AM to 5PM. The column of each block is the time block, textbox and a save button. Each textbox is color-coded to indicate if the time block is in the past, present or future. When editing the textbox, clicking on the save button will save the added event into local storage.
