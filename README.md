# Challenge 05 - Work Day Scheduler

This project is to create a password generator with the use of HTML, CSS and JS. When the page is loaded, you will be presented with a title of "Password Generator", an empty text box with the heading of "Generate a Password", and a button labeled as "Generate Password".

When 'clicking' the button, you will be prompted with a series of questions to ask for the following: 
- minimum password length
- maximum password length
- if the password contains lowercase letters, uppercase letters, numbers and/or Special Characters.

Once criteria for the password have been selected, the randomized password will be printed onto the text box.
